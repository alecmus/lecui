The lecui user interface library is designed for the rapid development of modern, efficient and easy to maintain C++ applications with a graphical user interface (gui). It is part of the \href{https://github.com/alecmus/liblec}{\texttt{ liblec libraries}}.\hypertarget{md__r_e_a_d_m_e_autotoc_md6}{}\doxysubsection{Successor to the cui framework}\label{md__r_e_a_d_m_e_autotoc_md6}
The lecui user interface library is designed to be a successor to the older \href{https://github.com/alecmus/cui}{\texttt{ cui framework}}. But why? It features newer technologies, greater flexibility and a more robust architecture. Below are some of the most important differences between the two\+:


\begin{DoxyEnumerate}
\item Accelerated graphics -\/ while the former uses raw winapi, lecui uses accelerated graphics.
\item Transparency channels -\/ while all the widgets of the former are inherently opaque, lecui supports transparent widgets due to the more modern technologies that it harnesses.
\item Containers -\/ the former only has a single type of container (page) while the latter features a myriad of containers for a much more flexible design (pages, panes, tab panes, etc.). All containers support recursion; they can have not only widgets but also other containers, and the containers in them can also contain containers and so forth. This makes it possible to design advanced, compact modular user interfaces with layers. Every container supports transparency as well through the use of an alpha channel.
\item Scroll bars -\/ the way the former was designed from the word go does not support the overlap of widgets beyond the page or form; lecui supports this and vertical and/or horizontal scrollbars are automatically triggered to permit the user to scroll. These scroll bars are supported for all containers.
\end{DoxyEnumerate}\hypertarget{md__r_e_a_d_m_e_autotoc_md7}{}\doxysubsection{Usage Examples}\label{md__r_e_a_d_m_e_autotoc_md7}
Various useful usage examples are available in the \href{https://github.com/alecmus/lecui_demo}{\texttt{ lecui demo}} repository. These range from minimalist hello world examples all the way up to advanced multi-\/page and multi-\/layer apps.

Various screenshots are available in the following places\+:

\hypertarget{md__r_e_a_d_m_e_autotoc_md8}{}\doxysubsection{Prebuilt Binaries}\label{md__r_e_a_d_m_e_autotoc_md8}
Prebuilt binaries of the library can be found under \href{https://github.com/alecmus/lecui/releases}{\texttt{ releases}}.\hypertarget{md__r_e_a_d_m_e_autotoc_md9}{}\doxysubsection{Compile-\/time Dependencies}\label{md__r_e_a_d_m_e_autotoc_md9}
The library has the following compile-\/time dependencies\+:
\begin{DoxyEnumerate}
\item boost C++ libraries
\end{DoxyEnumerate}
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item assumes boost 1.\+72 prebuilt binaries are in C\+:\textbackslash{}local\textbackslash{}libs\textbackslash{}boost\+\_\+1\+\_\+72\+\_\+0
\item download prebuilt boost binaries \href{https://sourceforge.net/projects/boost/files/boost-binaries/}{\texttt{ here}}
\item For example, the binaries for boost 1.\+72 are \href{https://sourceforge.net/projects/boost/files/boost-binaries/1.72.0/}{\texttt{ here}}
\item For Microsoft Visual Studio 2019 you can download the file boost\+\_\+1\+\_\+72\+\_\+0-\/msvc-\/14.\+2-\/64.\+exe (64 bit) and boost\+\_\+1\+\_\+72\+\_\+0-\/msvc-\/14.\+2-\/32.\+exe (32 bit).
\item if the boost c++ library is installed elsewhere you will need to change the Microsoft Visual Studio project properties under Properties -\/ C/\+C++ -\/ General -\/ Additional Include Directories and also under Properties -\/ Linker -\/ General -\/ Additional Library Directories.
\end{DoxyItemize}\hypertarget{md__r_e_a_d_m_e_autotoc_md10}{}\doxysubsection{Building}\label{md__r_e_a_d_m_e_autotoc_md10}
Create a folder \textquotesingle{}\textbackslash{}liblec\textquotesingle{} and clone the repository into it such that it resides in \textquotesingle{}liblec\textbackslash{}lecui\textquotesingle{}. Open the Microsoft Visual Studio Solution file liblec\textbackslash{}lecui\textbackslash{}lecui.\+sln. Select Build -\/$>$ Batch Build, then select the desired configurations of the given four\+:
\begin{DoxyEnumerate}
\item Debug x86
\item Relese x86 (32 bit Release Build)
\item Debug x64
\item Release x64 (64 bit Release Build)
\end{DoxyEnumerate}

Build.

Three folders will be created in the \textbackslash{}liblec directory, namely bin, lib and include. Below is a description of these subdirectories.


\begin{DoxyEnumerate}
\item bin -\/ contains the binary files. The following files will be created\+:

\begin{DoxyEnumerate}
\item lib -\/ contains the static library files that accompany the dlls. The files are named after the respective dlls.
\item include -\/ contains the include files

\hypertarget{md__r_e_a_d_m_e_autotoc_md12}{}\doxysubsubsection{Microsoft Visual Studio}\label{md__r_e_a_d_m_e_autotoc_md12}
Open your project\textquotesingle{}s properties and for All Configurations and All Platforms set the following\+:
\begin{DoxyEnumerate}
\item C/\+C++ -\/$>$ General -\/$>$ Additional Include Directories -\/$>$ Edit -\/$>$ New Line ... add \textbackslash{}liblecLinker -\/$>$ General -\/$>$ Additional Library Directories -\/$>$ Edit -\/$>$ New Line ... add \textbackslash{}liblec\textbackslash{}lib
\item Debugging -\/$>$ Environment -\/$>$ Edit ... add PATH=\textbackslash{}liblec\textbackslash{}bin;PATH\%
\end{DoxyEnumerate}

Now you can use the required functions by calling \#include $<$liblec/lecui/...$>$

Build.\hypertarget{md__r_e_a_d_m_e_autotoc_md13}{}\doxysubsection{Using the library}\label{md__r_e_a_d_m_e_autotoc_md13}
The smallest possible gui app is as follows\+:


\begin{DoxyCode}{0}
\DoxyCodeLine{\#include <liblec/lecui/form.h>}
\DoxyCodeLine{}
\DoxyCodeLine{int main() \{}
\DoxyCodeLine{    liblec::lecui::form("{}Form"{}).message("{}Hello world!"{});}
\DoxyCodeLine{    return 0;}
\DoxyCodeLine{\}}

\end{DoxyCode}


The above code displays the following form\+:~\newline
~\newline
 

Surely, it doesn\textquotesingle{}t get easier than that!

For more sophisticated examples refer to the section \textquotesingle{}Usage Examples\textquotesingle{} above.

And that\textquotesingle{}s the point of this library\+: to allow you to make a simple gui app with minimal code but also give you the power to build a marvel if you need to.\hypertarget{md__r_e_a_d_m_e_autotoc_md14}{}\doxysubsection{Deploying your Application}\label{md__r_e_a_d_m_e_autotoc_md14}
If it\textquotesingle{}s the 32 bit build you will need to deploy it with lecui32.\+dll in the same folder. If it\textquotesingle{}s a 64 bit build use the lecui64.\+dll.
